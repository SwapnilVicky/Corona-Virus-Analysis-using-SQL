# Corona-Virus-Analysis-using-SQL

# This Project is a part of Internship Program by @Mentorness. 

# Objective
This project is designed to test your SQL and data analysis skills in a real-world context. You are
encouraged to be creative in your approach and to seek guidance and assistance as needed throughout
the internship.

# Overview
The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent
need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, you have been
tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present your findings.

# Dataset
Description of each column in dataset:

* Province: Geographic subdivision within a country/region. 

* Country/Region: Geographic entity where data is recorded.

* Latitude: North-south position on Earth's surface.

* Longitude: East-west position on Earth's surface.

* Date: Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.

* Confirmed: Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.

* Deaths: Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.

* Recovered: Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.

# What you have to do?
For tasks details, use “Reference File for Problem Statements” which includes 16 questions for performing
detailed analysis. You have to find the answers by writing SQL queries
